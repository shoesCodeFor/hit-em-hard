# Hit-em-hard

Load testing is a common need when benchmarking web-servers.  This is a simple node module for performing this process.  

You can run processes like this with AWS Lambda or across remote networks.  There is an excellent primer on the why and how of this problem here: https://medium.com/postman-engineering/dont-get-techcrunched-performance-testing-for-your-http-apis-3196e40f6b70

This module is a proof of concept on the development side of creating such a tool.

### Use at your own risk!  Running this tool across multiple networks can knock down your server or get you flagged for malicous intent.  Please make sure to only direct this module towards your own instances. 
## DO NOT USE THIS TO TEST SOMEONE ELSE'S SERVER
